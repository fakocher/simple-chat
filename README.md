# Simple Chat

This is a simple chat created for the first lab of the Msc course Advanced Software Architecture and Design (ASAD) at the HES-SO, Lausanne.

## Usage

- Add the Java classes root path `<path-to-project>/out/production/simple-chat` to your environment variable `CLASSPATH`.
- Run `start rmiregistry`. It should open a blank CLI.
- Run the `Server` class with Java (from your favorite CLI or IDE). It should output `Server ready`.
- Run the `Client` class. It should output `Ready to chat!`.
